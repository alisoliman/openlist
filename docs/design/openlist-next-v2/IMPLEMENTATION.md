# Openlist Next v2 — native implementation notes

Source of truth: `body.html` (markup) and `design.jsx` (logic) in this folder.

## Architecture

- `openlist/Next/` holds the redesigned UI. Existing views remain for features the
  design doesn't cover (document editor, settings window, sheets for list move etc.).
- `NextTheme` — tokens (paper #FCFBFA, sidebar #F1EEEA, inspector #F7F5F2, ink #17161A,
  semantic colours), Instrument Serif (bundled, `Resources/Fonts`), density, motion.
- `Workbench` (@Observable, on AppEnvironment) — design interaction state: keyboard focus,
  visible order, completion dwell (`closing`), fresh/restored/flying rows, sidebar pulse,
  tray, session change log, inbox triage (kept/reviewed), G-prefix.
- `Workbench+Actions` — every design action (done, today, tomorrow, star, plan, priority,
  labels, move, trash, restore, keep, schedule, fit) goes through here: mutation via Store,
  undo registered on the window UndoManager (snapshot-based where Store has none),
  change-log entry, tray.
- Completion dwell defers the real `store.toggleCompletion` until dwell+300ms; Undo during
  dwell cancels. Pending closings flush on termination.
- `NextKeyMonitor` — NSEvent local monitor implementing the global key model when not typing.
- Shell replaces NavigationSplitView: custom sidebar (236), 52pt toolbar with drag gesture,
  inspector overlay (360), tray, selection bar, capture/search/palette overlays, work notch.
- Modal flags reuse `navigator.isSearchOpen` and `navigator.isCommandPaletteOpen`; ⌘N goes
  through `env.presentTaskCapture()`, which opens the workbench capture
  (`workbench.openCapture`), so menu commands keep working.
- New route `.settings` for the in-window design Settings page (full Settings window stays
  reachable via "More settings…").
- Lists are the design's document (`NextDocument.swift`): `NXDocumentOutline` draws the
  `OutlineEditor` engine under its `.nextDocument` policy, tasks on `NXTaskRowChrome` (the
  Next row's chrome with the live text as its title) and the other kinds in the same
  language. Done top-level tasks leave for the Completed group below. Each line's edit is
  one undo step with the design's label and a change-log entry. The Tasks presentation is
  the same document showing only its tasks. `Navigator.legacyDocumentOwnsKeys` (the Inbox
  document) and `documentOwnsEditorCommands` (any list) replace `hasDocumentEditor`.
